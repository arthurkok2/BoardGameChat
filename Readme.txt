BoardGameChat

Welcome to BoardGameChat, a platform that uses AI to help people learn and discover new board games.

Background:

My name is Brendan and I'm the Head of Open Owl Studios. We've created the games Stars of Akarios, Mythwind, and Stonesaga. I've loved seeing the growth of AI and have wondered how to integrate it with board games. After some experimentation with ChatPDF.com, I decided to create a small web app called boardgamechat.com that used chatGPT 3.5 to interact with a set of rulebook PDFs. After using it for a bit, I realized that the best (and most fun) way forward for BoardGameChat would be to open-source it. This is the ethos of the online board game community, we love to be involved and contribute to each other's projects, and this is a great platform to do just that.
